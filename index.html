      <h2>LOVE NATURE</h2>
      <p>
        We live on the most beautiful planet, Earth which has very clean and
        attractive nature full of greenery. Nature is our best friend which
        provides us all the resources to live here. It gives us water to drink,
        pure air to breathe, food to eat, land to stay, animals, plants for our
        other uses, etc for our betterment. We should fully enjoy the nature
        without disturbing its ecological balance. We should care our nature,
        make it peaceful, keep it clean and prevent it from the destruction so
        that we can enjoy our nature forever. Nature is a most precious gift
        given by the God to us to enjoy but not to harm.

        Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever since it has
        taken care of mankind and nourished it forever. In other words, it
        offers us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of
        damages and harms. Survival of mankind without nature is impossible and
        humans need to understand that. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur

      <h2>Look Deep into nature</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the very law of impermanence is one of the most powerful
        realizations along a path of embracing all that life has to offer. And
        we don’t need to look further than nature to gain this understanding;
        the weather, the seasons, the trees, the movement of the ocean, the
        cycle of the moon, the Earth’s constant rotation, the death and re-birth
        of all matter, and more. Everything rises and passes naturally.
        Suffering does not exist within this rising and passing. We humans
        simply experience suffering when our mind mistakes what is permanent
        with what is impermanent. Let me explain.
